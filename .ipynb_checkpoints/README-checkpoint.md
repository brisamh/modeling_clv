## Analysis

The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the variables. Summary statistics, correlation heatmaps, and visualizations such as histograms and boxplots were used to identify patterns, outliers, and potential relationships between customer features and lifetime value. Predictive modeling techniques were applied, starting with baseline regression models.
